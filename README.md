# optimized-resource-allocator-program

## Files Included:
    1. Solution.py (The Intended Solution to the problem statement).
    2. test_Solution.py (testcases to be run on Solution.py).
    3. Solution_user_ip.py (To Run the program with inputs from the user).

## Steps:
    1. Taking the input.
    2. Feeding the Input into A Recursive Function to generate All combinations possible with the given capacities of containers.
    3. Taking the Number of Containers for each combinations.
    4. Calculating the costs used by each combination.
    5. Taking the lowest Value and its corresponding number of containers.
    6. Display.
    
[Note: May take Longer time for Inputs generating products more than 1500]
